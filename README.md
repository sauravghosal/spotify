## Spotify Playlist Mockup
This project is a Spotify playlist design mockup built using **ReactJS**. Based on the user's song library, you can click a button add songs to your queue, which you can see displayed on the queue page. In order to make the Cards and Navbar for the site, I used React Bootstrap. 

To start the web app, clone the repository using the following command:

    $ git clone https://github.com/sauravghosal/spotify.git
   
Then, make sure you install React Bootstrap and other required modules by typing

    $ npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap
    $ npm install

 And... you're ready to run the web app! Type in your command line
 
    $ npm start

and you're all set!
